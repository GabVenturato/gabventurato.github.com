Hi, I'm Gabriele Venturato, a PhD student in the [DTAI](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/) research group at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/), supervised by [Luc De Raedt](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/people/lucderaedt). I obtained both my bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science at [University of Udine](https://www.uniud.it).

At the moment I'm focused on **neurosymbolic reinforcement learning**. In particular, on how to combine a symbolic representation (aka logic) with deep reinforcement learning, to improve training and obtain policies that must respect some (safety) properties. I'm also interested in SAT solvers, temporal logic and formal methods.
