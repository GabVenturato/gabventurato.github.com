Hi, I'm Gabriele Venturato, a PhD student in the [DTAI](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/) research group at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/), supervised by [Luc De Raedt](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/people/lucderaedt). I obtained both my bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science at [University of Udine](https://www.uniud.it).

At the moment I'm focused on planning and (safe) reinforcement learning. In particular, on how to exploit a symbolic representation (aka knowledge compilation) to perform inference and learning on decision making under uncertainty in dynamic domains; and on learning policies that must respect some (safety) properties. I'm also interested in SAT solvers and formal methods.
